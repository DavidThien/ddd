    Friedrick&#x27;s Landing
</h1>
<p class="description">
  &nbsp &nbsp - &nbsp &nbsp
  the start of our adventure
</p>
</div>

<p>The largest city on Edermayer, Friedrick's Landing still retains much of the
liveliness that existed before it was under the crown of Setallia. Although the
majority of the trade activity happens in the northern port of New Cametton,
Friedrick's Landing still sees a good amount of ships through its port.
Recently, mainland Setallians have also made their way over to Friedrick's
Landing, mostly for sightseeing.</p>
<p>Natives on Friedrick's Landing are largely antagonistic towards the Setallian
crown, and although they tend to be nice to the tourists, most of them are
waiting for the time they can return back to the pirate town they once had.
Tensions are exacerbated here because Setallia forcibly renamed the town from
its original name of Freeman's Landing. The new town guard are very strict on
this, and will arrest anyone using the old name.</p>
