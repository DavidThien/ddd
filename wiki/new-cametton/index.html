<h1 class="title">
    New Cametton
</h1>

<p>The major trading hub of Edermayer, and the largest island in the Mantay Sea.
Even under the pirates, the port saw massive business, although it was a
slightly more illicit variety back then. New Cametton also has the largest
Setallian presence on the island, and most of the natives have been kicked out.
The few remaining are loyal to the Setallians, although perhaps more because
they sense business opportunity than because they are loyal to the Setallian
Crown.</p>
<p>New Cametton is also where the majority of the timber industry on Edermayer is
focused, and several small hamlets and farms have popped up nearby to support
the operation. There is also a large shipyard building ships out of the new
Gloombark lumber.</p>
<p>There are also rumors of exploration into the northern part of the island
starting from New Cametton. The mountains are thought to be largely impassible,
and dangers lurk in the unexplored sections of the island, as well as rumors of
artifacts from generations long past.</p>
