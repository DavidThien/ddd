Before even the modern age of seafaring, the island nation of Edermayer was
known by many. In more recent years, the island has become a safe haven for
reputable outlaws of all types. Known colloquially as "the Pirate Island", the
locals might disagree with the assessment that all who come here are on the run
from the law, but even they won't refute that this island welcomes all with open
arms. Provided, of course, that you aren't here to stir up trouble.

Edermayer has a long history, much of which is lost to time at this point. What
texts remain however, paint the story of a nation at the center of political
struggles, embroiled in campaigns of war, and leading the modern age into a new
era of connectedness. I've spent the last several decades of my life on the
island, primarily serving as a librarian, but all the while cataloguing
historical texts, and accounts from locals who have been around for many
generations. Through my research, I've assembled the most complete history of
the island to date, and one which I hope will prove useful to our future.
