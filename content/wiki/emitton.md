Emitton was once the city of the pirates. It was here that Captain Ragbones
returned to celebrate after every successful voyage, and where the sailors of
the Pallid Rose took refuge and defended against the armada of the Tharean
Dynasty. Ever since the Setallians took over, they have fiercely defended the
port, and ensured that no outside vessels get into Gleamcraw Cove. No natives
are even permitted inside the city. Rumors abound as to what the Setallians are
up to, but it seems they have something big to hide, whatever it is.
