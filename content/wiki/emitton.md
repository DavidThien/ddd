Emitton sits on the Northern end of the island of [Edermayer](../edermayer).
Historically, this has been the most pirate-centric city on the island, and was
often seen as a return to safety after a long voyage at sea. It was here that
Captain Ragbones returned to celebrate after every successful voyage, and where
the sailors of the Pallid Rose took refuge and defended against the armada of
the Tharean Dynasty.

Thanks to its history, Emitton has been fiercely defended against the Setallian
navy since their arrival. Impassioned resistance ensured the port remained free,
and that no hostile vessels made it into Gleamcraw Cove. Now, it remains the
last city free of Setallian rule on the island, and the headquarters for the
pirate resistance.

Rumors abound as to how the city has been defended for so long, even after
intense naval attacks. Some believe that the Setallians let the pirates keep
their last safe haven on the island in an attempt to placate further antagonism.
Others speak of an artifact in the city which can control the very sea. Whether
these rumors are true or not though, Setallian forces have been amassing nearby
for what looks like an all-out attack on this last bastion of the pirates.
