Edermayer is a fairly large island situated in the Mantay Sea. It has been a hotly contested island ever since people took to the seas, being acquired and lost by most of the major kingdoms of the region. However, for the last 100 years, it had remained a free state. What little governance it saw, was on a local basis, usually by councils who oversaw a minor peacekeeping force to keep things from getting too out of hand.

Thanks to its independence from any established kingdoms, Edermayer became a safe haven for pirates, who upheld an unspoken agreement to keep the island free from any grander ambitions. Of course, there was the occasional violence from rival factions, and more than one attempt to seize the power of the island, but the pirates always saw that any attacks on their freedom were dealt with swiftly.

This safe haven held until 2 years ago when the newly crowned Queen of Setallia, Queen Donna II, sent a massive naval armada to claim the island. Those living on the island at the time were caught unawares, and the Setallian navy was able to destroy the coastal defenses at all the major ports before any significant retaliation. The Setallian force of some 10,000 men aboard nearly 40 ships was able to quickly take the majority of the island, and began establishing order.

The island is now being used for various industrial purposes by Setallia. A mining operation digging up ore to take back to the mainland is underway in the mountains. Additionally, extensive logging and shipbuilding are taking place after special properties of the native Gloombark trees were discovered.

Although Edermayer has been claimed by Setallia for 2 years now, there is still much of the island they lay claim to only in theory. In practice, much of the northern section of the island has proven too much effort for them to establish a base there. A combination of nearly impassible terrain, dangerous creatures, rumors of cursed caves, and pirate resistance have stymied efforts thus far. Gleamcraw Cove remains the only area with any Setallian presence.

After so many years of occupation by the Setallian army, the locals are beginning to get restless. The restrictions on their freedom and business, as well as the incessant proselytizing by the Hivodian Church, have created discord among many. The pirates who were unceremoniously booted from the island have also been planning their revenge. There is an air of change spreading that even the Setallians can feel. Setallia must prepare for the storm ahead, or the pirate refuge of Edermayer will have its day once again.
