Not much is known by the locals about the Lost Finger, other than there is a
large fort on one of the islands which has historically housed many pirate
captains before famous voyages. Very few on the island have been in the fort
before, but those who have speak of a great library and never before seen ocean
charts with instructions on how to get to long forsaken treasure. Only officials
from Setallia are allowed on the island now, and those who try to get into the
fort aren't heard from again.
