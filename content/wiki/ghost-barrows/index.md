The Ghost Barrows is a district outside the walls of Siren's Keep in [New
Cametton](@/wiki/new_cametton.md). Against the western wall surrounding the old
district are ramshackle houses made of flimsy wood, tarps, and whatever else can
be thrown together to provide cover from the elements. Further East, along the
coastline, sits the Ashtomb, the giant prison on the island which forms an
imposing black pillar along the skyline.

The whole area seems to have a faint haze to it, as though the terrible inside
of the Ashtomb is leaking out into the surrounding area. The guards of the
prison all deny it when asked, but even they can be overheard grumbling about
having to sit in the uneasy fog coming from the ancient magic within.

Those seeking streetwise information from the unseen can come here if they know
how to ask. Rumors of cult activity in have always plagued the area as well, but
nothing has ever been proven.
